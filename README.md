# Vue Desktop Example

This was initialized with `vite create` and uses Vue 3.

A demonstration of the use of vuedraggable.next, flex-box, responsive styling, and Vue to implement a desktop-like interface where you can drag and drop icons in a sorted fashion.

## Building

Use the following commands to build or develop the application:

``` bash
# runs the application locally in dev mode, with hot module reloading
npm run dev

# builds the application to /dist, to be served in production
npm run build

# serves the files from /dist to preview the production app
npm run preview
```
